        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of this project is to create a parallelized system capable of searching for a keyword on Google, retrieving a list of relevant websites, and extracting contact page details and email addresses from these websites. The system will significantly reduce the time required to gather large-scale contact information and produce a well-organized dataset for further use.

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Manual data collection from websites is slow and inefficient. Sequential web scraping methods are time-consuming, especially when dealing with large datasets. This project proposes using parallel processing to speed up the extraction of contact information from websites, enabling faster and more efficient data gathering.

        <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Search Engine Querying:</strong>
                <p>Query Google for a specific keyword and retrieve a list of relevant URLs.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Input:</strong> User-provided keyword (e.g., "best digital marketing agencies").</li>
                    <li><strong>Output:</strong> List of URLs containing relevant contact information.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Web Crawling:</strong>
                <p>Crawl the retrieved URLs and navigate to contact-related pages (e.g., "Contact Us," "About Us") to extract contact details.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Input:</strong> List of URLs from Google search.</li>
                    <li><strong>Output:</strong> Contact page URLs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Contact Information Extraction:</strong>
                <p>Extract email addresses, phone numbers, and other relevant details using regular expressions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Input:</strong> Contact page URLs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Output:</strong> Extracted contact information (e.g., emails, phone numbers).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Parallel Processing:</strong>
                <p>Use multiprocessing or ThreadPoolExecutor in Python to process multiple websites in parallel, significantly speeding up the crawling and extraction process.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Input:</strong> List of websites to crawl.</li>
                    <li><strong>Output:</strong> Fast and efficient data extraction.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Dataset Generation:</strong>
                <p>Organize the extracted contact information into a structured format (CSV/JSON) for easy analysis.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Output:</strong> Structured dataset with website URLs, contact page URLs, and extracted contact details.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Programming Language:</strong> Python</li>
            <li><strong>Libraries:</strong> Requests, BeautifulSoup, re (Regular Expressions), Multiprocessing/ThreadPoolExecutor</li>
            <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> CSV/JSON format</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Expected Outcome</h2>
        <p>The system will generate a dataset containing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A list of websites that matched the search query.</li>
            <li>The URLs of the contact pages within the websites.</li>
            <li>Email addresses, phone numbers, and other relevant contact details.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This dataset will be valuable for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identifying businesses and their contact information for marketing purposes.</li>
            <li>Understanding how businesses display contact information on their websites.</li>
            <li>Facilitating communication with potential clients or customers by providing accurate contact details.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            This project will create a powerful tool for large-scale web data collection using parallel processing techniques. By automating the process of crawling websites and extracting contact information, it will provide businesses and researchers with an efficient way to generate valuable datasets. The use of parallel processing will ensure that even large-scale data collection efforts can be completed in a fraction of the time traditionally required.
